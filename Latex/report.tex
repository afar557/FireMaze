\begin{problem}
	Write an algorithm for generating a maze with a given dimension and obstacle density p.
	 
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
	The solution to problem one goes here.

% LaTeX Tip: The figure environment is used for displaying the figure. Inside that, we use \includegraphics for adding a different file for each of the figure.
% What you need to do is to create your figure using any tool you like (including drawing it by hand and scanning it), turn it into a pdf, name it "tree[X].pdf" 
% where you replace [X] by A,B,C, or D depending on which part you are solving (i.e., use treeA.pdf, treeB.pdf,...). Finally, copy the file in the same directory
% as this template and you should see that getting compiled into your solution. You can change the width=0.5\textwidth command to fix the size of the figure
% in the final PDF. Finally, if the figure appears in the next page, do not worry about it as they will still have the proper caption.

\begin{problem}
	Write a $DFS$ algorithm that takes a maze and two locations within it, and determines whether one is reachable from the other. Why is $DFS$ a better choice than $BFS$ here? For as large a dimension as your system can handle, generate a plot of 'obstacle density p' vs 'probability that S can be reached from G'
	
\end{problem}

\smallskip

\begin{solution}
	Solution to problem two goes here. 
\end{solution}


\smallskip


\begin{problem}
	Write $BFS$ and $A*$ algorithms (using the euclidean distance metric) that take a maze and determine the shortest path from $S$ to $G$ if one exists. For as large a dimension as your system can handle, generate a plot of the average $'number$ $of$ $nodes$ $explored$ $by$ $BFS$ - $number$ $of$ $nodes$ $explored$ $by$ $A*$' vs $'obstacle$ $density$ $p'$. If there is no path from $S$ to $G$, what should this difference be? 
	
\end{problem}

\smallskip

\begin{solution}
    If there was no path from S to G then there would be no difference between the number of nodes explored. This is because A* and BFS each would try to exhaust every possible option and would therefore have the same number of nodes explored.

\end{solution}

\smallskip

\begin{problem}
	What's the largest dimension you can solve using $DFS$ at p = 0.3 in $less$ than a minute? What's the largest dimension you can solve using $BFS$ at p = 0.3 in $less$ than a minute? What's the largest dimension you can solve using $A*$ at p = 0:3 in $less$ than a minute?

\begin{problem}
	Describe your improved Strategy 3. How does it account for the unknown future?
\end{problem}

\smallskip

\begin{solution}
	Solution to problem four goes here. 
\end{solution}

\smallskip

\begin{problem}
	Plot, for Strategy 1, 2, and 3, a graph of `average strategy success rate' vs `flammability q' at p = 0.3. Where do the different strategies perform the same? Where do they perform differently? Why?
\end{problem}

\smallskip

\begin{solution}
    Strategy 1:
	\begin{figure}[h]
    \centerline{\includegraphics{P6ST1.png}}
    \caption{Strategy 1, Using a dimension of 100, average of 50, p=0.3, q with step of 0.1.}
    \label{fig}
    \end{figure}
 
    
    Strategy 2: 
    \begin{figure}[h]
    \centerline{\includegraphics{P6ST2.png}}
    \caption{Strategy 2, Using a dimension of 100, average of 50, p=0.3, q with step of 0.1.}

    Strategy 3: 
    \begin{figure}[h]
    \centerline{\includegraphics{P6ST2.png}}
    \caption{Strategy 3, Using a dimension of 100, average of 50, p=0.3, q with step of 0.1.}
    \label{fig}
    \end{figure}
\end{solution}

\smallskip

\begin{problem}
	If you had unlimited computational resources at your disposal, how could you improve on Strategy 3?
\end{problem}

\smallskip

\begin{solution}
	Solution to problem four goes here. 
\end{solution}

\smallskip

\begin{problem}
	If you could only take ten seconds between moves (rather than doing as much computation as you like), how would that change your strategy? Describe such a potential Strategy 4.
\end{problem}

\smallskip

\begin{solution}
	Solution to problem four goes here.
